Handout: Setting Up R and Rstudio, a guide for a continued success
================

The language of data analysis is the R programming language. It powers
the work of people like data scientists, statisticians, social and
natural scientists all over the world by allowing them to perform and
communicate their data analyses in a principled way.

Throughout this course you’ll learn how to program in R and use the R
programming language to make graphics, produce reports and even create
interactive web applications. Before you do, you’ll need to get yourself
ready by installing:

-   the R programming language on your computer
-   an integrated development environment (IDE) called RStudio that
    allows you to write R programs and interact with R code on your
    computer.

There are many other guides available for installing R that are just a
web search away. One particular favourite is this guide by Kieran Healy
from his [Data Visualisation book](http://socviz.co/index.html#install).
It is also worth reading the [appendix](https://socviz.co/appendix.html)
which provides a comprehensive tutorial on how to read R documentation.

Getting started: what’s the difference?
---------------------------------------

You might be asking: so what’s the difference between R and RStudio?
[Julie Lowndes](http://jules32.github.io/resources/RStudio_intro/) gives
a great answer:

> If R were an airplane, RStudio would be the airport, providing many,
> many supporting services that make it easier for you, the pilot, to
> take off and go to awesome places. Sure, you can fly an airplane
> without an airport, but having those runways and supporting
> infrastructure is a game-changer.

The following provides an overview of how to download, install and get
up and running with R and RStudio.

Download and install R
----------------------

You can [download the R language from the Comprehensive R Archive
Network](https://cran.r-project.org/) or CRAN for short.

On the CRAN website, there are a list of links to download R for
different operating systems, for example, Linux, (Mac) OS X and Windows.
To download R to your computer, select the link that corresponds to your
operating system. You can then install R.

Download and install RStudio
----------------------------

Once you have installed R, you are ready to install RStudio. For this
course, the free version of RStudio is suitable. Get RStudio from the
[RStudio downloads
page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Select the
**‘Download’** link and then select the installer that corresponds to
your operating system.

R and RStudio on Windows
------------------------

If you are a Windows user, the CRAN website will redirect you to a page
with a list of subdirectories. Select the link called **`base`**.

*Please note, the following image is an example only; the version listed
on the website may differ.*

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<img src="img/R-install-windows.png" alt="CRAN website, Windows link" width="1680" />
<p class="caption">
CRAN website, Windows link
</p>

</div>

You will be directed to a new page with a link to download R, for
example, **`Download R 3.6.2 for Windows`**. Select the link to download
R for Windows.

Once R has finished downloading, open the **.exe** file and work through
the setup prompts. Once the setup is complete, [download the latest
version of the
RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download//#download)
executable. Then, open the **‘.exe’** file and work through the setup
prompts.

R and RStudio on Mac OS X
-------------------------

If you are a Mac OS X user, the CRAN website will redirect you to a page
with a list of releases. Select the link, for example, **`R-3.6.2.pkg`**
to download the latest release.

*Please note, the following image is an example only; the version listed
on the website may differ.*

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<img src="img/R-install-macos.png" alt="CRAN website, MacOS  link" width="3336" />
<p class="caption">
CRAN website, MacOS link
</p>

</div>

Once R has finished downloading, open the **‘.pkg’** and then work
through the setup prompts. Once the setup is complete, [download the
latest version of
RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
Then, open the **‘.dmg’** file and then follow the prompts.

Check your installation!
------------------------

Well done, you’ve installed R and RStudio on your computer. Open RStudio
to check that everything has installed correctly and to explore the
RStudio interface. The RStudio interface should be divided into **four**
panes:

-   **scripts** pane - the place where you write and save your R code.

-   tab for the **console** - the place where your code gets run. You
    can write code directly in here, but you might forget the code you
    write, so it’s a good idea to write your code in the **scripts**
    pane.

-   tab for **Files**, **Plots**, **Packages**, **Help**, and a
    **Viewer** - files are listed here, just like a ‘Finder’ in Mac OS X
    or ‘My Computer’ in Windows.

-   tab for **Environment**, **History** and **Connections** - things
    you create in R that are a result of code being run, such as data,
    objects and models are listed in the **Environment**.

</div>

Playing with the console
------------------------

Continue to explore RStudio by making your way through this exercise -
using R as a calculator. At the prompt of your **console** in RStudio,
run the following code chunk:

    1999 * 2 / 1000

    (39 + 13 + 2) / 4

    cos(pi)

Store the results of your computation as an object using the left arrow
**`<-`** (The shortcut in RStudio is **Alt + -**).

Again, at the prompt of your **console** in RStudio, run the following
code chunk:

    my_variable <- 7 * 8

### What’s it doing?

This is read as **`my_variable`** gets the value of **`7*8`**. In your
RStudio the object called **`my_variable`** should be listed in the
**Environment pane**.

Print the value of **`my_variable`** again by typing **`my_variable`**
at the console.

### Naming conventions are important!

Names of objects are important. You want them to be descriptive, and if
you have multiple words in a name you need a way of dealing with that.

The convention we will use in this course is *snake\_case*, where we
separate multiple words by an underscore, and use all lower case. The
most important thing though is to be consistent with your names.

Names are **case sensitive** and their **spelling** matters, otherwise R
will not be able to correctly interpret the result.

Try running the following code:

    my_Variable

    my_varíable

### Why does R give you an error?

R gives an error for the first line of code because there was an upper
case **`V`** instead of a lower case **`v`**. Similarly, the second is
an error because there was an accented **`i`** instead of an unaccented
**`i`**.

Using functions
---------------

Most computations are performed by using *functions*. Functions take
some input (arguments) and return an output. As an example, let’s use
R’s built-in random number generator function **`runif()`** to generate
10 random numbers between 0 and 1.

If you type the number 10 as the first argument you will get 10 random
numbers between 0 and 1.

    runif(10)

    #>  [1] 0.92839886 0.46449002 0.04818191 0.69480327 0.41724380 0.32039746
    #>  [7] 0.52299628 0.87792516 0.25499229 0.22415195

If you type **`runif()`** in the RStudio console and then press **TAB**
on your keyboard, a floating tooltip will appear that contains the names
of the inputs to the function.

You can be more explicit by specifying each input:

    runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 1)

    #>  [1] 0.21405482 0.89502499 0.94233480 0.02090746 0.69556738 0.96907639
    #>  [7] 0.30527574 0.77819456 0.83322272 0.69442338

By changing the values of the arguments, we can finally generate our
numbers between 0 and 10.

    runif(10, min = 0, max = 10)

    #>  [1] 0.10186119 9.00398050 3.24546894 0.03419559 4.35507091 4.08026104
    #>  [7] 3.57905883 7.64683251 1.86506479 4.88547155

And you can save the result to an object using the **`<-`** operator.

    y <- runif(10, min  = 0, max = 10)

    y

    #>  [1] 9.757155 9.057057 3.806425 2.415137 6.622209 1.045418 3.047164 4.792180
    #>  [9] 4.068325 8.059160

### Computing summaries

So far, you’ve explored the basics of using R as a calculator and
creating objects and calling functions.

Consider expanding your R vocabulary by using the following functions to
compute the **mean** using the **`mean()`** function, the **variance**
using the **`var()`** function, and the **range** using the
**`range()`** function of the object **`y`** you just created. Again,
you can do this from the **Console**.

Remember, if you are not sure how to use the function, type the name of
it in the console and press **TAB** on your keyboard.

Lab Exercise: so random!
------------------------

-   **You may have noticed the numbers you generated at your R console
    are different from the ones presented earlier. Why is that?**
-   **Look up the help file for the function `set.seed` by typing a
    question mark in front of it at the console: `?set.seed`.** If you
    need help understanding this read over this
    [document](https://socviz.co/appendix.html).
-   **How could you use it to ensure you get the same random numbers?**

Setting up for success: data science workflow
---------------------------------------------

When working on a new project, it is possible for your files to be
spread out and stored in different locations across your computer.

This can create problems, particularly when you are programming because
knowing exactly where your files are is really important. When they are
spread out, this makes extra work for yourself.

Getting into the workflow
-------------------------

Storing files in folders, and folders in a ‘filing cabinet’ helps
centralise your work: it keeps it organised so it is easier to find.

Using **RStudio projects** is like providing a filing cabinet for your
work! Using them centralises your work, making your life easier as you
do not have to manage where files are. For each project, you need to
create **one** RStudio project.

Creating a new RStudio project
------------------------------

Make your way through the following steps to create an RStudio project
on your computer for all the work that you’ll do in this course.

### Step 1: Start a new project

On your computer, open RStudio. Then, select **‘File’** &gt; **‘New
Project’**.

</p>

</div>

### Step 2: Set a directory

A pop-up window labelled **‘New Project’** should be displayed in
RStudio. From the pop-up window, select **‘New directory’**.

<img src="img/Rstudio-04.png" alt="Project type" width="793" />
<p class="caption">

</p>

</div>

### Step 4: Give your directory a name

Enter the name of the directory you want to create. It would be a good
idea to name it by the course you are taking, like “intro\_datascience”.

Select **‘Create project’** once you’ve named your directory.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<img src="img/Rstudio-05.png" alt="Naming the project" width="789" />
<p class="caption">

</p>

</div>

### Step 5: Well done, you’ve now created a RStudio project!

Your RStudio will have a projects tab on the upper right hand corner.
Remember, every time you start to work on something for this course, be
sure to open this project!

Whenever you are ready to write code for the course go to your project
folder and then select the <strong>‘.Rproj’</strong> file. This will
automatically open RStudio and take you to the right directory!

</div>

Installing packages
-------------------

Packages are the way R users share useful code. You can think of each R
package as a book. Once you’ve installed a package, you can load the
code contained in it using `library` - which is like checking out a book
from the library!

There are more than 14,000 packages available on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) contributed by a range of R users,
from experts to those relatively new to R. There are another thousand or
so on the [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) archive, which
focuses primarily on bioinformatics applications. There are many more on
people’s Github pages that may be in development. For example: [Earo
Wang’s `mists` package](https://github.com/earowang/mists)

As an example, you can install the `rmarkdown` package for making
reproducible reports using the following code chunk:

    install.packages("rmarkdown")

Lab Exercise: Setting yourself up for the course
------------------------------------------------

Continue to develop your skills in RStudio by making your way through
this exercise. Follow the instructions specified in **‘Creating a new
RStudio project’** to create another RStudio project that will contain
all your materials as you work through this course.

Then, use the console to install the
[`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and
[`visdat`](http://visdat.njtierney.com/) packages. You’ll use these
packages throughout the course to read, visualise and analyse data.

After you’ve installed the packages, run `library(tidyverse)` at the
console, then, run the following code chunk:

    glimpse(diamonds)
    filter(diamonds, carat <= 2.5)

-   **What happened when you ran `library(tidyverse)` at the console?**
-   **Do you think that you’ll always need to run that code to use the
    `tidyverse`?**
-   **What happened when you ran the code chunk?**
